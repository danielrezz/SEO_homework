<h1>SEO Homework</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
    This is our first homework assignment where we had to replace all non-semantic HTML elements with semantic elements. I also had to translate any changes or discrepancies to the CSS file. It was a learning experience, but definitely got me more comfortable with reading through basic code.
    </p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
    <p> 
    Open up the HTML document and analyze the back-end. You can also see the Horiseon website functioning as intended.
    </p>

<h2>Tests</h2>
    <p>
    The website functions as intended without any visual flaws or broken links. It has been tested multiple times.
